This repo is in dire need of a cleanup. 

TODO ITEMS (in order):

- Get Visual Studio project settings working with relative paths
- Remove or figure out way to not include all of the required DLLs etc. (might be no way around this)
- Update to latest Visual Studio toolchain
- Migrate to CMake project
- Update to latest/modern CPP standard and remove unneeded libs (e.g. boost smart pointers not needed anymore, probably more)
- More TODOs will be added as required
